The notebook `clustering_report` is the final report. It contains a function, `recommend` that recommends movies based on the polarity of tags and the ratings. 

The notebook `feature_engineering_tags` is where I tokenized and prepared the tags for clustering. 

The notebook `useless_musings` is nothing meaningful. I kept it because I wanted to keep the resources I found in the notebook but I didn't do any clustering or useful feature engineering in that notebook.
